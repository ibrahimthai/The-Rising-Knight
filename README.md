# The-Rising-Knight
The game consists of a knight who holds a sword. The knight
automatically runs (to the right) and will be defeating monsters. The point of the game is
to keep defeating monsters as much as you can without dying. There are two main
buttons: Jump, Slash, and Lunge
Monsters will come towards you while you're running. If you
survive, overtime more monsters will spawn and their speed will increase. This is just
the basics of the games. We have added fighting combos, items, and more character and stage selections.
